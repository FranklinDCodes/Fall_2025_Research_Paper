\section{Dataset Creation}
\subsection{Generate stock list}
\subsubsection{Download stocks by market cap}
    I downloaded a list of all stocks ranked by market cap off the internet, and saved it as a .tsv
\subsubsection{Read tsv}
    Run the stock list builder, which starts by reading in the file as a pandas dataframe
\subsubsection{Iterate while stock list is $<$ 1500}
    Create empty list for stock symbols. Continue to perform the following while the stock list len is $<$ 1500.
\subsubsection{Grab next highest symbol}
    Grab next symbol from ranking dataframe.
\subsubsection{Download data}
    Attempt to download day candles going back to the date 01/01/2011 - $\Delta$(days=100).
\subsubsection{Check dates captured}
    Check if the download captured 01/01/2011 (oldest date to be used) and 12/31/2024 (most recent date to be used).
\subsubsection{Check context captured}
    Check that there are at least 50 days of data before the first date (so that the first training example will be for 01/01/2011)
\subsubsection{Judge stock}
    If stock data download captured data range and addition context, it gets added to the list. Otherwise it gets rejected.
\subsubsection{Save list}
    Once 1500 stocks have been accepted into the list, save it as a text file of tickers.
\subsection{Setup downloads}
\subsubsection{Decide on train set date ranges}
    I made a .md file that numbers and outlines the date range for each dataset.
\subsubsection{Decide on eval set date ranges}
    Each evaluation set is 1 year long and has a first date that is 1 year after the end of the training set data is corresponds with.
\subsubsection{Create bash files}
    I created 2 bash files for training and evaluation that run the download script for each dataset with it's unique arguments.
\subsection{Download dataset (for each training and eval set)}
\subsubsection{Collect args}
    Collect arguments pertaining to date range and save location.
\subsubsection{Load stock list}
    Load stock list text file as a list.
\subsubsection{Open thread pool}
    Open pool of threads for calling downloads like follows based on each stock in the list.
\subsubsection{Call download}
    Download from (01/01/start\_year - context*2), to 12/31/end\_year with auto-adjust = false
\subsubsection{Update indexing structure}
    Reset columns to be base OHLCV. Reset df index.
\subsubsection{Get important data}
    Index needed data out of dataframe with (first day of start\_year - context) : (last day of end\_year)
\subsubsection{Save}
    Save stock data to csv file

\section{Training Setup}
\subsection{Load Config}
\subsubsection{Load}
    Load config as json object with path from positional arg
\subsubsection{Unpack}
    Unpack config keys into variables
\subsection{Setup regulator}
\subsubsection{Init regulator}
    Pass starting learning rate and other kwargs from config
\subsection{Load dataset}
\subsubsection{Init dataset object}
    The dataset object is initialized and given config. Then the load dataset method is called which does the following.
\subsubsection{Verify files}
    Loads all csvs in dataset and verifies a minimum length. A legacy feature at this point.
\subsubsection{Split files into task groups}
    List of valid files is split into groups to have each group loaded with threads.
\subsubsection{Open dataset thread pool}
    Open thread pool to load files.
\subsubsection{Load csv files}
    Open every file from directory listed in config. Load as pandas dataframe with date index column and put them all in a list.
\subsubsection{Calculate indicators}
    Calculate all additional features listed in configs. Cut out any data at the front of the dataframes that is missing these features (e.g. for rolling avgs).
\subsubsection{Create date feature}
    1hot encode day of the week and add the new weekday features to all dataframes.
\subsubsection{Slice data into training examples}
    Use rolling window to cut each dataframe into training example dataframes with n day history. All examples get added to a list and labels are made into a dataframe of their own.
\subsubsection{Normalize examples}
    Each dataframe training example is normalized using norm function from config.
\subsubsection{Create tensor input}
    Each dataframe is converted to numpy then a tensor with the datatype and device listed in the config. All labels are converted a single tensor as well.
\subsection{Load model}
\subsubsection{Dynamically load model class}
    The Python file containing the model class is loaded by name using importlib.
\subsubsection{Call init}
    Init custom model class. The custom model class is passed a name, starting LR, and input feature count from dataset. The model inherits from torch.nn.Module which is also inited.
\subsubsection{Setup pytorch objects}
    Model class init sets up LSTM object and Sequential object for forward passes, a default optimizer, a null loss func and an empty history.
\subsubsection{Set optimizer}
    Call model set optim method to initialize and save optimizer to model class.
\subsubsection{Send to device}
    Set model to device specified in config.
\subsection{Setup scheduler}
\subsubsection{Init scheduler}
    Pass optimizer from model. Give it kwargs from config
\subsection{Setup dataloader}
\subsubsection{Check for test set}
    Check's to see if the model save config contains test set indices. For loading a partially trained model. Indices get set after init if none are there. Pretty much a vestigial feature.
\subsubsection{Call init}
    Init object and pass in dataset object (and test set indices if applicable)
\subsubsection{Pick test indices}
    If not test set indices were passed, create list of indices and either random sample indices (legacy) or slice chunk off the front to create test set indices.
\subsubsection{Seperate test set}
    Use indices to make a mask and remove test examples from all indices to get training set indices
\subsubsection{Shuffle train set}
    random.shuffle train set indices
\subsubsection{Split batches}
    Split train set indices into batches using a list comprehension and slicing with option to drop last partial batch. Transforms list[int] -> list[list[int]]. Casts result to tensor.
\subsubsection{Setup first inputs}
    Create empty list for inputs and labels. Prefetch first n batches by indexing them out of dataset and adding them to input and label sets. Remove these indices from batch indices.
\subsubsection{Load test set}
    Index test set and labels out of data and Store
\section{Training Loop (per epoch)}
\subsection{Setup}
\subsubsection{Get regulator coefs}
    Pass regulator lr and get the coefficient for each logit. Coefficients will be stepped down if LR has changed
\subsubsection{Update loss}
    Call function to init custom MSE loss and pass it the regularization coefficients. Call method to set new loss for model class.
\subsection{Train batches}
\subsubsection{Unpack dataloader}
    Each iteration grabs a batch from the loaded set of batches. If the loaded set is empty, the dataloader loads indexes more batches out of the dataset. Continues until all batch indices are popped.
\subsubsection{Forward pass}
    Call model forward with batch inputs
\subsubsection{Call backward pass}
    Pass model backpass method the logits and batch labels (with added time series dimension). Starts by putting model in train mode.
\subsubsection{Calc loss}
    Zero optimizer gradient then run model's built-in loss function. Backwards' the loss.
\subsubsection{Optimize}
    Step optimizer.
\subsection{Save}
\subsubsection{Checkpoint model}
    Save epoch copy of model as pkl to model save dir. Includes model params as well as model training history.
\subsection{Validation}
\subsubsection{Eval setup}
    Set model in eval mode. Create data structures for saving outcomes and losses.
\subsubsection{Open each item in test set}
    Iterate over test set inputs and labels. Do the following for each one
\subsubsection{Forward pass}
    Call model on test input
\subsubsection{Calculate loss}
    Grab close price (3rd label item), and pass high and low price into loss function
\subsubsection{Update outcome counts}
    Decipher outcome as either win, stop-loss, both (loss), neither, missed win, missed loss, missed stop-loss, missed both, or missed neither. Also update the count for the broader category of loss, and update the counts for why the win was missed (predicted stop-loss, predicted neither, predicted both).
\subsubsection{Final calculations}
    After all examples are run through, calculate the following statistics: win rate, random win rate, guess rate, average timeout, and average eval loss
\subsubsection{Update scheduler}
    Send average example loss to scheduler.

    Load config as JSON object.
\subsubsection{Unpack eval config}
    Unpack values from config as variables.
\subsubsection{Load training config}
    Load the config that was used for training the model as a JSON object.
\subsection{Load model}
\subsubsection{Dynamically load model class}
    The Python file containing the model class is loaded by name using importlib.
\subsubsection{Call init}
    Init custom model class. The custom model class is passed a name, starting LR of 0, and input feature count from config. The model inherits from torch.nn.Module which is also inited.
\subsubsection{Setup pytorch objects}

% \section{Ease of Use}

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% \begin{table}[htbp]
% \caption{Table Type Styles}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
% \hline
% \textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
% \cline{2-4} 
% \textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\

% \end{table}

% \begin{figure}[htbp]
% \centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
% \caption{Example of a figure caption.}
% \label{fig}
% \end{figure}

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
